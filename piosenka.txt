Don't look back into the sun
You've cast your pearls but you're on the run
And all the lies you said, who did you save?
And then they played that song at the death disco
It started fast but it ends so slow
And all the time it reminded me of you

They will never forgive you but they won't let you go (let me go)
She will never forgive you but she won't let you go, oh no

They will never forgive you but they won't let you go (let me go)
She will never forgive you but she won't let you go, oh no
